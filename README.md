# Quill ImageResize Module with imports error fix

A fork for quill-image-resize-module that fix "Cannot read property 'imports' of undefined"
Because the author haven't accept [pull request #38](https://github.com/kensnyder/quill-image-resize-module/pull/38) yet, I created this fork. 

See it's documentation in [here](https://github.com/kensnyder/quill-image-resize-module),
